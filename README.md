# GM-Electrification-Analysis
This repository contains the code for the MSc Data Science Extended Research Project (ERP):
**“Data-Driven Spatial Analysis for Building Energy Decarbonisation in Greater Manchester.”**

The project integrates EPC data, population statistics, and climate projections to analyse spatial patterns of building energy efficiency and forecast future energy demand under electrification and climate change scenarios.

## Data Access
Note: Original datasets are not included in this repository due to data protection and size limitations.
Please refer to Section A1 of the Technical Appendix in the ERP report for detailed instructions and official download links to:
- EPC certificates (OpenDataCommunities)
- UK Postcodes data (GitHub repository)
- ONS population estimates and projections
- UK Climate Projections (UKCP)
- After downloading, place the datasets into a /data directory before running the notebooks.

## Workflow
- The notebooks are organised into thematic tasks. A suggested order of execution is:
- task1_1
- task1_2
